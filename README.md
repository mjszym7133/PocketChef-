# Python_Encoder-
Repository for class project. 

This program enables the user to Encode and Decode a written message using the range, len, chr, and ord functions. When the code prompts the user comands, all commands must be typed with the first letter being upper case and the rest of the word typed in lower case.

I created this code as a beginning project to combine a variety of python functions that I have learned so far. This project still exists in a basic form and I plan on continuing to develop this code as my skills increase. 

In the future I plan to apply this code to a GUI. Most likely Tkinter.
